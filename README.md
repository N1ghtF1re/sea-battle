Getting started
--------------------
To start playing, you need to post SEABATTLE.exe and player1.txt with
player2.txt in one folder. player1.tht and player2.tht must be filled with the location of the ships (M - sea, K - ship). Location example:

```

MMMMMMMMMM
MKMKMKMMMM
MKMKMKMMMM
MMMMMMMMMM
MKKKMMMMMM
